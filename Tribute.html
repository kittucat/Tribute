<h2> He is an excelent asshole and a perfect rug, when he dies I will stuff him up and place him in the livingroom </h2>


<h4> This is Bobo </h4>


<p>He loves getting dressed up in diffrent hats and clothing especaly his rainsuit when its raining since he hates the
   rain. Though he loves snow and he will do the zoomies if he finds snow. He loves treats and is kinda afride of me though I dont know why
   since Ive never hurt him, though I have scared him with plastic but it is kinda hard to not have plastic in your life or
   something loud. I never try and scare him unless Im trying to teach him not to be scared, I know how it sounds. Anyways
   I try to help him as much as I can but hes a little bitch. </p>
